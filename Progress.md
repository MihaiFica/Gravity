## Phase 1: 

-> BlackHole and Player with 2d colliders and rigidbodies 
-> WASD (Top down) movement for our player ( might be changed in the future ) 
-> Bordering the player movement's to screen ( using camera & Mathf.Clamp ) 
-> Player health system ( + Ui )
-> Asteroid & Sattelite prefabs with colliders , rigidbodies and script for movement towards the Black Hole 
-> Spawning Asteroids and Sattelites in random positions (outside of camera vision ) with random moving speed 
-> Player death on collision with BlackHole and if no life points remaining -> Managing score
